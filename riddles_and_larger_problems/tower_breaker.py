"""
Two players are playing a game called Tower Breakers. The rules are as follows:

There are n towers, each of height m.
The players take turns. Player 1 always goes first.
On each player's turn, the player must choose a tower of height h and reduce its height to any number x, where 1 â‰¤ x < h and x divides h evenly.
If a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
Given the number of towers n and the height of each tower m, determine which player will win if both play optimally.
